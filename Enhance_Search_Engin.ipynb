'cause you could. you could win. i mean, i'm guessing. if you wanted to. if you didn't want to, then, of course, you wouldn't. i'd be rooting for you. in a tasteful way, of course. congratulations, aldo. you've managed to pervert the pillsbury doughboy. everybody chill a little. it's just a harmless night's entertainment. it's not harmless to humiliate women. these women are not humiliated. they get free beer, prizes, and... a lot of compliments. and if they're really lucky, bronchitis. i can't believe that they still have wet tshirt contests. i thought that fad was over a long time ago. that's the thing about towns like belmar. they don't go in for that trendy stuff like hot oil wrestling or whipped cream aerobics. these towns stick with what's real, what's enduring, what works. look at this. he's like a scummy charles kuralt. you don't get it, do you, aldo? a wet tshirt contest isn't good, clean fun. these women are human beings, not objects to be hosed down, put on display, and judged like pigs at the state fair. it's an honor to be one of those pigs. you know what? the truth is, it's not even their fault. they're just the damaged products of a repressed society. they've grown up being told a woman's body is a dark, forbidden secret. that's why they jump at every opportunity to peek. so? so if society had a healthy attitude, you guys wouldn't cram yourselves into some dark, sweaty room and drool all over each other, trying to stare at some stranger's breasts. you know what, miranda? you're right. society does need to change, and hopefully someday it will. but until then, we got some drooling to do. don't you want to get a tan? i want to do it gradually. the umbrella's a big step for eddie. last week he stayed under the boardwalk. i don't want to get too tan too soon. how will that happen? you never take your shirt off. at least i'm not the whitest one on the beach. look at that guy. that's a septic tank. tan monitor, if i fall asleep, throw a hat on me. big night last night, huh? some were bigger than others. hey! why not go after eddie? he was there, too. you should really go after aldo. he brought along a supersoaker to hit any spots they missed. sounds like you had fun. well... no. i mean, i wasn't hollering or shouting. i just watched. yeah. like this. i didn't go up to the contestants with paper towels and offer to pat them dry. that's funny. how about when aldo yelled, you'll put an eye out with those? do you think those were her own? no. they came with the shirt. miranda! oh, my god! are you crazy? should i enter them? i can't believe this. you believed in it last night. you paid money for it. what's wrong with it today? miranda, someone's going to see you. what are you worried about, zack? these are no big deal, not after friday night's yabbo mania. is she dressed yet? miranda, why are you doing this? because these guys are full of crap. they can't look at breasts. they have to leer at hooters, like they're not even attached to a person. o.k., i see they're attached. would you put your top back on? if every woman took her top off at the beach, breasts wouldn't be considered these mystery prizes anymore, and that would be the end of wet tshirt night. i'll never go again. i promise. would you come out of there? they are just breasts. i guarantee if you look at them long enough, they'll get really boring. is zack looking? no! will you come on? eddie, sit down. is it that hard to get used to? no. no. no. no. no. no. good. it's very natural. of course it is. now the rest of society has to catch on. oh, no. oh, my god. all right, donna. what the hell? hi. how was the beach? it was great. never again. ow. eddie took his shirt off. congratulations, eddie. what was the occasion? he was just following the crowd. what are you talking about? oh, arden, you should've been there. it was the first time in my life that i felt really free! there was nothing between me and the wind! you mean you two were... topless? when i think of how many years i've spent covering myself up hold it! you two sat on belmar beach topless? yeah. i missed it! i was on the phone. my aunt theresa's in the hospital. that bitch! wait a second. didn't anybody say anything to you guys? an old woman walked by and told eddie to cover up. she noticed i was turning red. so when we going back? anytime. we didn't do it to give anybody a cheap thrill. it was a political statement. and if that's what it takes to change society, i'm ready to walk into the ap with my top off. i'll start the car. come on, aldo. grow up, huh? and what happened to you? he went to the beach a little boy and came home a man. if aunt theresa lives, i'm never talking to her again. arden, want to try it tomorrow? oh, no, thank you. i believe in what you're saying, but my seventh grade teacher sister mary katherine gave me a wise piece of advice. show your boobs, burn in hell. the more i thought about what miranda said, the more hypocritical i felt. it took a few minutes to get used to seeing them topless, but after a while, it's no big deal. it's just another part of the body. thank you, zack. no. thank you, miranda. so, what's for dinner? all this freedom's got me hungry. knock on door can i help you? i'm looking for miranda halpern and donna shipko. oh, my god. the police. are you ms. halpern and ms. shipko? yes. i'm ms. halpern. what's the problem, officer? a complaint was filed against you two for indecent exposure. you were observed in a seminude state cavorting about at the public beach. uh, excuse me, officer. i was there, and i can testify that there was no cavorting. there was sleeping. there was sunbathing. there was a little panicking maybe, but definitely no cavorting. sorry. i have a witness who would challenge that. who? mrs. hilda wennig. oh, no. she saw me drop a plum pit on the sand once and ran after me with a kayak paddle. she also carries a polaroid at all times. i think she's done some of her best work here. oh, my god, i'm a cavorter! these are very interesting, officer. i think i just found my christmas cards. get away! i need those. sir, regarding these photos, i have one request. could you crop me out? all we did was take off our tops to sunbathe. that earns a 265 fine in this town. that fine is absurd and puritanical. i have no intention of paying it. let me get my purse. donna! look, miss, you violated town ordinance 16121, and you have two choices. on monday morning, report to the local precinct to pay the fine or contest the charges at the county courthouse. lots of luck. let me ask you something. where were you last night when 30 pairs of breasts were being hosed down at mickey green's bar for the enjoyment of this town's depraved male population? second row. i'm fighting this. did you hear that? indecent exposure. i guess that creep considers wet tshirt night decent exposure. i'm a criminal! donna, stop crying. you have nothing to be ashamed of. wearing a uniform doesn't make someone right. we're right. if we're going to fight this, we got to do it through solidarity. we can win this thing, but we have to stick together. this is all your fault! did you know that in at least six states laws have been enacted to prohibit wet tshirt contests? did you know our lease says we can be evicted for lewd behavior? lewd? i didn't see you checking the lease last week when aldo brought home that movie bend over betty. hey, she was a gymnast. i'm taking this to court. this is a perfect example of the hypocrisy of this place. you made the front page of the asbury park press. oh, great. overexposed. that's the headline. summer renters charged with indecency. look. hilda even got a photo credit. wait. let me see this. do they mention my name? oh, yeah. good. i hope they spelled it right. they spelled all our names right. men shouting hey, why don't you guys go do something constructive, like a cave painting? oh! oh! what's going on out there? oh, nothing. just a pack of 20 slobs. they're drunk and disgusting, and... some of them mooned me. hey, i know those guys. you are those guys. i don't think i can take much more of this. hey, sweetheart! aah! you're going through with this? yep. let's get our stuff. we can beat the sunday traffic and avoid being hung naked from our willow tree. the whole summer is ruined. what happened? they wouldn't serve me at the dairy queen. they said they don't serve people like me. then this little boy dumped a great mr. misty on my shoe. all set. hey, how's donna doing? she's still in her room. she's been up there all day. you have my number in the city? why? in case they give you one phone call. thanks. good luck, miranda. i hope you win. if i can help, let me know. i'm with you all the way. how about one quick peek to remember what i'm fighting for? get out of here. hi. hi. what you doing? getting my stuff together for tomorrow. i'm paying the fine. i figured you would. miranda, why do you have to go through with this? i can't help it, donna. when i see that something's wrong, i want to change it. but look what it's doing to everyone's summer. i don't care about everyone. what about me? i know you like this stuff. it's like a mission for you. you have a cause, and you know you're right. even i know you're right. then why won't you come fight this with me? because my parents live near here. my father reads the press every night after work. if we fight this, he's going to keep reading about his daughter taking her top off on the beach, and i got to live with them. sooner or later, you got to stand up for what's right, even with your parents. it's not just them. it's me. you like it when you walk down the street and people think, there goes that... activist? no. troublemaker? no. pain in the ass? that's it. so? so i don't. i like it when i walk down the street and people think, what a nice person or she's always so happy. and i don't care about wet tshirt contests or taking our tops off at the beach, because the truth is neither of them really affects my life. but it does affect your life, donna. it affects all women everywhere. i don't know, miranda. my life is going to work and answering phones and living at home and sitting on a train two hours a day. it's hard enough to be happy without trying to change the world. now for a few months, i get a chance to spend my weekends down the shore with my two best friends. and that's what's really important to me. miranda, i've never asked you for anything. please just pay the fine tomorrow... for me? i can't, donna. hi. donna, where were you? we'll be late for work. how long could it take to pay a fine? i didn't pay the fine. what? i decided that if miranda felt so strongly about this, i should stick by her. i went in to see this old, creepy judge. i said that this was a town of hypocrites and that we were tired of living by men's twisted, perverted rules. sometimes we get pushed too far, and we have to take the law into our own hands like thelma and louise. and they can fine us, and they can arrest us, and they can even throw us in jail, but they can't shut us up... ever. bravo. where were you? our case got called. i had to go in there without you. i paid the fine. you what? i paid the fine. you wanted me to pay the fine. i paid the fine. oh, miranda, you paid the fine. she paid the fine. you paid the fine... for me. and you didn't pay the fine. and i didn't pay the fine. i didn't pay the fine. i told off the judge, and he found me in contempt, and i'm going to go to jail. and this is all your fault! advertise your product or brand here contact www.opensubtitles.org today\""
